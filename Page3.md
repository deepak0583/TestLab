# Environment Deployment Time

Each lab environment takes the following duration to provision and made ready for use:

|Lab Environment|	Deployment Time|
|---------------|----------------|
|Lab 1	|60 Minutes|
|Lab 2	|20 Minutes|
|Lab 3	|120 Minutes	|
|Lab 4	|20 Minutes|
|Lab 5	|60 Minutes|


As the deployment takes longer time, if you want to start the lab at a particular time, please provide the information **in advance** on when you want the 
lab to be ready to moc-support@spektrasystems.com and our team will be able to schedule the deployment to be ready at the time you requested for. 


# Environment Duration and Uptime Limits 

Each Lab environment has two characteristics. Let us take a moment to understand them.

i)	**Environment Duration**: Environment will get deleted after a specified number of hours. E.g, Lab environment 1 duration is 96 Hours since it will be used for all 4 days to complete various lab modules. 

ii)	 **Environment Uptime**: Lab environments typically include Virtual Machines and SQL Pool. VMs and SQL Pool have uptime limits to keep the cloud costs under control.  E.g, Lab environment 1 includes 6 Hours of SQL Pool and VM uptime limit (2 hours per lab module). Once the uptime limit is reached, all resources will remain in stopped/pause resource.

iii)	 Please see the duration and uptime limits configured for **DP-203 Lab environment** below: 

a.	**Lab Environment 1:** Includes Module 1,6,15  

    -Duration Limit: 96 HR 
    -Up time Limit: 06 HR
    
b.	**Lab Environment 2:** Includes Module 2 

    -Duration Limit: 2HR
    -Up time Limit: 2 HR
    
c.	**Lab Environment 3:** Includes Modules 4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 and 16. 

    -Duration Limit: 96 HR
    -Uptime â€“ 18 HR
d.	**Lab Environment 4:** Includes Module 14 

    -Duration Limit: 2 HR
    -Uptime Limit: 2 HR
e.	**Lab Environment 5:** Includes Module 17 

    -Duration Limit: 03 HR
    -Uptime Limit: 03 HR

iv)	Once the uptime limit is reached, all resources will remain in stopped/pause resource. Please contact support to increase the uptime and note that additional charge will be incurred if the uptime is more than what is provided with the lab.
